# Eureka Admin - Client Spring boot application 

Dockerized Spring Boot application with Eureka Admin and client services.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. See running for notes on how to run the project on a system.

### Prerequisites

1. Clone the project to your local environment:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ankitrajput0096/Eureka_Admin_Client_SpringBoot
    ```

2. You need Docker to be installed:

    #### Windows:
    https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe
    
    #### Mac:
    https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg
    
    #### Ubuntu:
    https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

### Installing

Once you have docker installed on your environment, install the project dependencies via:

Build docker Image:

```
docker-compose build
```

Start docker:

```
docker-compose up
```
Or


Start docker with scaled up services:

```
docker-compose up --scale clientone=2 --scale clienttwo=3

```

## Running

Start docker:

```
docker-compose up
```
Or


Start docker with scaled up services:

```
docker-compose up --scale clientone=2 --scale clienttwo=3

```
### NOTE:
Can scale up clientone and clienttwo services to max instances of 5.
If you want to scale even higher, then increase the port range in `docker-compose` file.

Your main Eureka Admin server should be now running on http://localhost:8761
